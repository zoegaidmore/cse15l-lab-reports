# Lab Report 4 - Vim

**Step 4:** Log into ieng6

Keys pressed:

`<up><enter>`

The command to log into my ieng6 account (`ssh zgaidmore@ieng6.ucsd.edu`) was one up in my terminal history, which is why I used the up arrow once, to access the command, then entered. This successfully logged me into my ieng6 account.

**Step 5:** Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account (using the `SSH` URL)

Keys pressed:

`git clone <command v><enter>`

I typed `git clone` because it is the command to clone a repository. Then, I typed `<command v>` to paste the `SSH` URL, which I had copied from the github repository. This successfully cloned the repository.

**Step 6:** Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail

Keys pressed:

`cd L<tab> <enter>`
`bash test.sh <enter>`

I typed the command `cd` to change the directory into the repository that I had just cloned (`Lab7`). I then typed `L` and then the `<tab>` key, which completed the name of the directory I wanted to `cd` into (`Lab7`).

NOTE: I changed the name of my forked repository in github from `lab7` to `Lab7`, because during lab I had git cloned the `lab7` repository, so to demonstrate these steps a second time I had to rename it, as a `lab7` directory was previously made.

I then typed the `<enter>` key, successfully running changing the directory.

Then, I typed `bash test.sh`, before using the `<enter>` key to successfully run the tests, which were in the `test.sh` file.
