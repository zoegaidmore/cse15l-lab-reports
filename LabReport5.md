# Lab Report 5 - Putting it All Together

### Part 1 â€“ Debugging Scenario 

**The original post from a student with a screenshot showing a symptom and a description of a guess at the bug/some sense of what the failure-inducing input is. (Don't actually make the post! Just write the content that would go in such a post)**

Hi there, my ListExamples.java code isn't passing my tests, and I'm not sure what's wrong.

I've attatched an image of the symptom of the bug. The test file tests the merge method with the arrays `["a", "b", "c"]` and `["a", "d"]`. Initially I thought that it was a problem in my iterating over the arrays, because it appears that the last element of the second array wasn't added to the merged array. However, I don't see any issues with my while loop.
